## Nijmegen - Spark Data Frame API

The goal of assignment 3 part B is to gain hands-on experience with Spark SQL and DataFrames
by carrying out an analysis on structured open data.

The repository for the assignment contains the course's notebook and three extra data files.


### Big Data Spark Nijmegen notebook

Copy the course's notebook from your assignment 3 repo, or from the course repository
([`BigData-open-data-Nijmegen.snb`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rubigdata/course/gh-pages/assignments/BigData-open-data-Nijmegen.snb))
into the docker container in directory `/opt/docker/notebooks/BigData`
(just like you did in assignment 3 Part A).

Open [localhost:9001/tree/BigData](http://localhost:9001/tree/BigData) in your browser, 
and open the notebook you just installed inside your Spark Notebook container.

Follow the instructions in the notebook, and do not just click through every single cell - experiment with
alternatives, you will need the experience when you write your blog post!

**When you get stuck, open an issue in the
[Forum](https://github.com/rubigdata/forum-2017)
to find help from your fellow students and/or me!**
