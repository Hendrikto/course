## Practical Assignments

### Objectives

The practical work for the course serves two main objectives:

1. Get to know the emerging Big Data platforms in more detail by using them, with a focus on data analysis using Spark.
2. Gain hands-on experience using modern development tools and services, including `git`, `github`, `docker`, `Jupyter notebooks`, *etc.*.

### Completing and Evaluating Assignments

In this course, we use *Github for education* to hand in **brief** reports (like a blog post) about the results of the 
practical work. Standard git functionality serves perfectly for carrying out peer review, and keeping track of 
modifications in response to feedback.

Refer to [assignment 1a](assignments/A1a-blogging.html) for more details about the blogging framework.

Doublecheck with [Blackboard announcement](https://blackboard.ru.nl/webapps/blackboard/execute/announcement?method=search&context=mybb&searchSelect=_115038_1) 
to avoid common mistakes.

### Assignments Schedule

#### February 21st: Setup and first test blog

Completing the first assignment is not evaluated. However, I expect that every student will be able 
to create their assignment reports in Markdown and have these converted to HTML at their github page,
and know how to use Docker on their hardware of choice (be it a laptop, their home computer or
a PC in HG 00.075).

Usually, working with big data requires accessing a large cluster through a remote shell (`ssh`).
If you are not that familiar with using a computer from the commandline in a terminal, or struggle 
with UNIX commands, I recommend this [UNIX Tutorial for Beginners](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/);
nicely organised by topic. 

Once you have your template blogpost published and Docker installed, explore Scala using the links
in assignment 1B. Write up your experience in markdown, following 1A to publish those as a first blog post.

Instructions (assignments A1a and A1b):

* [Assignment 1a](assignments/A1a-blogging.html)
* [Assignment 1b](assignments/A1b-docker.html)

__Final words:__ _Practice makes perfect_.
 
Take your time to improve your CLI (CommandLine Interface) skills! 
Mastering UNIX is a steep learning curve, but the time invested pays back bigtime in the long run.

#### March 14th: Hadoop and Map-Reduce

The objective of assignment 2 is to gain some hands-on experience with HDFS.

The first week, we install HDFS in pseudo-distributed mode, and explore the default examples.
The subsequent weeks, you write your blog-post discussing your own Map Reduce jobs on your own cluster.

* Assignment 2 [description](assignments/A2-mapreduce.html) and [invite](https://classroom.github.com/a/H-Hs6uhw) (please accept only once)

_Enjoy the Elephant in the Room!_
